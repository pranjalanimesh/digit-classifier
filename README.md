# Digit Classifier ML Model using MNIST Database
This project is a basic implementation of neural networks that can classify hand-written digits using the MNIST database.
### Overview
The MNIST database is a large collection of images of hand-written digits. It is commonly used in machine learning research as a benchmark dataset for image classification models.

In this project, we will use the MNIST dataset to train a neural network model to classify hand-written digits.
